== Clorun
The tool for bootstrapping and installing software on Amazon EC2 in multithreaded fashion. It is used with Opscode Chef configuration framework. 
Chef is used in 'solo' mode, no server is needed.
Originally written to fully automate deployment of distributed applications and make it as simple as one click.
Since tool knife has appeared in Chef (this utility was originally written before release), it's easier to use knife for many cases; still as of now Chef doesn't have a tool for one-click deployment of whole cluster in neither client-server nor solo mode.
